## About Biblion ##
Biblion helps academics in the area of biblical textual criticism to comprehensively study the Bible from public domain texts from various scriptural manuscripts and languages, commentaries, and theological dictionaries.

## About Biblionend ##
It is the BackEnd of the Biblion. Through the Biblionend, both the desktop application and the mobile application can interact with Biblio version data, books, and other Biblion content.

I chose to do the same in GraphQL to make it easier to search the data, as well as allow Biblion to be simple, having a single endpoint for calls from client applications.

## Technology ##
- Developed in GO
- MongoDB as Data Storage
- GraphQL to get query requests
